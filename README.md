# Pac-Man Game

This project is a recreation of the classic **Pac-Man** game, focused on implementing the core gameplay mechanics with clear structure and simple, readable logic.

The player controls Pac-Man inside a maze filled with **coins**. The main objective is to collect all coins while avoiding enemy ghosts that move around the maze. If Pac-Man collides with a ghost, the game ends.

The project includes **uploaded ghost images** intended for the ghost elements. However, a **Drake pixel art** sprite is currently used instead of the ghost sprites. Switching between the provided ghost images and the Drake pixel art (or uploading entirely new sprites) is straightforward and can be done easily by replacing or reassigning the sprite assets.
